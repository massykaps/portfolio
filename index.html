      <h3> About Me</h3>
      <p>The aim of me completing this course is firstly to upskill myself professionally by completing this part time 24-week software engineering course.</p>
       <p>I initially got involved in coding whilst working on web development projects at university. From that moment on a keen intrigue was born that brings me to where I am now, with the ambition of landing my first junior devleoper role. </p>
